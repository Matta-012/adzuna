## 🖥️ About the Project

### This project was developed for *academic purposes* and does not have any *monetization*.

eJobs is a solution to a problem that affects many of us: unemployment. Our application uses a database with job positions that are accessed through the Adzuna API. The user will have access to a list of jobs, completely free of charge, and will be able to apply for the job they want, filtering their search by country, category and title.

This project was the winner of a competition organized by [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/), in the front-end module transition week, as a bonus project for those who were up to date with the content on the Tribe B of cohort 15. The deadline for delivering the project was 2 days and, after its completion, we had to prepare a 3-minute pitch to present it to an examination board, where the following evaluation criteria were analyzed:

- Creativity;
- Innovation;
- Applicability; and
- Clean Code.

The goal of the project was to use an API chosen by the group and develop a web page that uses it.
